AUTO-LOADING FORTH source code, on COLD boot.

Mon Mar  8 02:23:22 UTC 2021
commit 3d55b432ebfef550795e9814487772653369e3b1

0x10040000 used as in SDK examples. 4095 bytes (plus a
terminating '\0').

ESC ends a 'reading' upload prematurely (and beneficially).
So no need to fill all 4095 bytes with unwanted keystrokes.

rewind still important - have not addressed when/how to
automate its obvious use case.

See the source for what it does.

copy_to_ram seems fine so far, in brief testing.

HEX 10040000 erase    .. that will moot the auto-loading

(erases your forth source from QSPI flashROM).


PROGRAM FLOW

SPECIAL Read-from-flashROM on COLD boot routine:

COLD calls Tflabort.  Tflabort calls Tflquit.

Tflquit calls Tflaccept.

Tflaccept does this:

 * examines inbound keystroke (faked from flash storage)

 * asks if it is 0x00 or 0xff

 * if it is either of those two, calls Tquit (not Tflquit).

 * if input char is not 0x00 or 0xff, interpret these
   keystrokes (characters) read in from QSPI flashrom,
   exactly the same way a keyboard input keystroke
   would have been (in the original 'accept' word).



NORMAL keyboard input based Interpreter:

Once normal program flow is re-established, with a call
to Tquit:

Tquit calls Taccept (rather than Tflaccept) and thus
  there is no further interaction with the QSPI flashROM.

Tquit is marked by the upstream author as 'never exits'

Tflquit looks very similar to Tquit but for a substitution
  of what the related 'accept' word looks like.

Initially there was only a single accept word.

It was deemed too difficult a novice project to combine
all this into a single 'accept' word that does it all.


CIRCUMVENTION

If no flashROM related behavior is wanted on a COLD boot,
simply edit the C source code and point to Tabort, rather
than to Tflabort, in the definition of the COLD thread.

Presently found at these line numbers (forth.c):

1369 THREAD(cold) = { Fenter,
1370     Tuinit, Tu0, Tninit, Titod,     /* important initialization! */
1371     Tlit, coldprompt, Tcount, Ttype, Tcr,
1372     Tflabort, };                      /* Tabort never exits */

Note that the upstream author ends Tabort, with that comma hanging there.

Or a typo crept in. ;)

On branch buffer-to-flash-c

END.
