A typical test is a call to COLD and a comment marking
the time ( like this 20:09:04 ) and then forgetting
about that picocom session and doing other work on
the Linux desktop.  picocom is the chosen 'hyperterm'
type program (microcom, minicom, seyon &c also apply,
as does Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE, for example).

Sometimes a longer USB 'extension' cable is used;
other times, direct 3 foot USB A to micro-B cable
is employed (the extension is used to more conveniently
depower the RP2040 to access USB bootloader mode).

  Still crashes. Takes a good long while, sometimes.

  Even after a -Wall flag to the compiler (code passes this test).

END.
