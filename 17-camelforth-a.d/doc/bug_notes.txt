Bug notes ;)

The bug returns - caught while idle in another session.

So the 32 bit unsigned int wasn't the issue.

Or was in addition to it.

The interpreter seems to operate by setting a flag
called 'run'.  No real guess as to when it gets set,
but if it has nothing to print but prints anyway,
that could be an issue

(a running print with no input, so it prints the
null that it 'has').

Just don't know.
